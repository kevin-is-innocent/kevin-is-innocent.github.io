Kevin came from an Irish working class background and was first
generation Scottish. He was horn in 1965 in Paisley, Renfrewshire, the fourth of
six children. He carried strong principles of what was right and what was wrong.
He was bullied at school until he learned to fight back. He had learning
difficulties which were never fully recognised. (Kevin was twenty-six before his
dyslexia was diagnosed in 1992). He had wanted to be an artist but truanted from
the art exam and took only metal and wood work.

The family of eight, parents and six children, lived in two
rooms and a kitchen. His mother especially, brought up her children, giving them
the values of her rural Irish upbringing and an appropriate code of conduct in
an urban working class community in the West of Scotland. His was a typical
enough childhood, except for the trauma, when he was about eight, of being with
a friend who was held at knife-point. The friend moved from the district but
Kevin remained with the memory haunting his childhood. Kevin was a timid child
with his big sister fighting his fights and often blaming Kevin for things that
were her responsibility.<br><br>

At twelve, when he changed schools, Kevin resolved that life would have
to be different if he was to survive and he started running wild with a gang,
abusing glue and alcohol. Kevin would have been an easy victim, a little spoken
child who daydreamed and didn't feel quite secure with the world. He'd been sent
to a speech therapist and psychologist and had had a brain scan when he was ten
but his learning difficulties were never assessed properly. Nothing abnormal was
found in this scan. The defence called psychiatrists who suggested that the fact
that Kevin had had such a scan was in itself proof of brain damage contributing
to Kevin having a personality disorder that was aggressively psychopathic. Dr.
Bob Johnson, in his recent report (1997), is highly critical of their
contribution to this "gross miscarriage of justice".<br><br>

At secondary school he was performing well enough not to be put in the
bottom stream but had himself moved there because they did more football and
art. By the time he left school he was a regular truant and had been brought
before the children's panel after a fight on the school bus. Kevin got a job in
a cobblers shop. He was in regular trouble with the police for minor offences
and spent a period of time in borstal and detention centre before being placed
on probation and moving to London.<br><br>

 ### Living on the Streets

Living on the streets in London is a question of survival and
the story was no different for Kevin who came to London searching for the
promised pavements of gold. Instead he found himself sleeping on the streets and
picked up by the police and placed in youth custody. He met Ricardo at
Centrepoint on his release and took to living in squats. It was after his second
period in youth custody that he met Christine and they agreed to marry.
Christine moved into the squat with Kevin, Ricardo and others. Ricardo felt
Kevin move away from their close relationship and this is why Kevin had not gone
with Ricardo who went to Derby the weekend before the events that led to Kevin's
arrest.<br><br>
