It is a scandal that 16 years on from his conviction no appeal has been lodged with the Court of Appeal. It is immediately apparent to any lay person that the police interviews with Kevin are unreliable: they are the only evidence against him. The jury were not aware of his linguistic disability, his "hidden handicap" . Nor were they made aware of a number of irregular aspects of the police investigation. Had they been made aware of these matters, they would not have been able to convict Kevin "beyond reasonable doubt".

Had professionals involved in 1994 properly appreciated the affect of Kevin's learning difficulties on the case they would surely have lodged an appeal immediately. As it is another eight years has dragged whilst even more evidence gathers and points to the ever-growing injustice that Kevin suffers. Kevin is a man of both great ability and disability who should not be in prison today because first and foremost he is innocent of this crime of which he is convicted.<br><br>

Can you begin to imagine what it feels like to be convicted and imprisoned for over ten years for a crime you did not commit? Can you begin to understand the triple injustice of Kevin who is unjustly convicted, has never had an appeal; who has spent most of the last eleven years on a high security status and who has learning difficulties?<br><br>

Kevin has received a further report from Dr. Chasty, a leading world expert on dyslexia, whose initial report was reported in The Scotsman in April 1994. The initial report in itself should have been enough to open the appeal door but it is very clear that the legal profession have a lot to learn about learning difficulties!<br><br>

We make the point that Kevin's case highlights a number of political issues of the day: education, law and order and prisons. 1 look forward to the day when Kevin can speak to these issues himself in justice done and freedom come but for the moment we have to ask that you raise these issues on his behalf wherever you have a voice.<br><br>
